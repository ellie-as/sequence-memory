## Learning to construct sequential events

Code for the preprint 'Consolidation of sequential experience into a deep generative network explains human memory, prediction and planning'.

#### Subfolders

* **narratives**: code for showing how the model neocortex learns the gist of specific events in Bartlett (1932) and Raykov et al. (2023), reconstructing them with gist-based distortions.
* **statistical learning**: code for Durrant et al. (2011) simulation.
* **inference**: code for exploring relational inference in a spatial and family tree task based on Whittington et al. (2020), and for showing how RAG supports inference from recent memory.
* **planning**: code for simulating the development of model-based planning abilities in Vikbladh et al. (2024) through consolidation.
* **misc**: Code for representing memories as gists and details, and for sequence compression results in the SI.
* **hopfield**: Code for simulations of asymmetric Hopfield networks in SI.
* **scripts**: Helper scripts and utils.
