Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said:\n",

The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), based on regions created by the Local Government Act 1972. Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 districts. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties (Dyfed, Powys and Gwynedd) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. In some cases, multiple Areas of Search were created based on multiple AOSs, with some counties and districts based on multiple AOSs.\n",

Before November 2004 the recognised qualification was the European Mountain Leader Award (EML). Following the establishment of the Union of International Mountain Leader Associations (UIMLA) in November 2004, EMLs have become International Mountain Leaders (IMLs). As an Association, BAIML now has over 600 members, most of whom hold the full IML award.\\n\\nQualifications\\nBritish IMLs have been assessed in the skills required for leading walking parties in mountains.

The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), based on regions created by the Local Government Act 1972. Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 districts. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties (Dyfed, Powys and Gwynedd) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. In some cases, multiple Areas of Search were created based on multiple AOSs, with some counties and districts based on multiple AOSs.\\nDue to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed.
