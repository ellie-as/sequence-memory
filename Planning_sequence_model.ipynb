    "#### Simulating Oliver's consolidation task\n",
    "\n",
    "Consolidation can be thought of as training a neocortical generative / predictive model on replayed hippocampal memories. For sequential data, the generative model could correspond to an autoregressive sequence model like GPT-2 that learns to predict the next item in the sequence (by minimising the prediction error on sequences from the training data). The stimuli for Oliver's task can be represented as sequences of form 'START: yellow fruit, STOP: red, REWARD: animal, SEQUENCE: yellow fruit (-1), green animal (2), red animal (2)', which makes it straightforward to train GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates the task as follows:\n",
    "* Pre-train model so that it learns the *rules* of task\n",
    "* Train on stimuli for task, representing consolidation\n",
    "* Compare generative model accept / reject performance before and after consolidation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-train model on arbitrary stimuli, to model learning the rules of the task. After this stage of training, the model can be given a prompt with randomly chosen stimuli / conditions, e.g. 'START: blue chair, STOP: sad, REWARD: bug, SEQUENCE:', and generate a sequence consistent with the rules, e.g. 'blue chair (-1), sad bug (2)'. But the model knows nothing about the task stimuli or their order. This is supposed to be equivalent to the participant at the point they pass the rules quiz, prior to experiencing the stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran the simulation for reward and transition revaluation separately (so there was enough data in each case - I could do both at once though, there'd just be less data to train on):\n",
    "* Reward revaluation: train on 2/3 reward categories in each trial, test on held-out reward category. Repeat n times, each time with a random stimuli order and a random reward condition.\n",
    "* Transition revaluation: train on 2/3 stop colours in each trial, test on held-out transition category. Repeat n times, each time with a random stimuli order and a random stop condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is more training data than in Oliver's task, as discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accept / reject task is modelled as follows:\n",
    "* Get the predicted sequence from the model given an input of form 'START: yellow animal, STOP: red, REWARD: animal, SEQUENCE:'\n",
    "* Extract the predicted rewards (any numbers in round brackets)\n",
    "* If predicted reward sum > 0, accept, and if predicted reward sum <= 0, reject\n",
    "* Calculate the accuracy of the accept / reject decisions by comparing with the real sequences\n",
    "* There are 81/3 = 27 test sequences in each case. Of these 9 are of length 1 (with the stop condition met by the start stimulus). I excluded these as these don't require any learning of the sequence to predict the reward.\n",
    "* As described above, there were multiple trials for each of the reward and transition revaluation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that the generative model (pre-trained on the rules of the task) learns the sequence of stimuli through consolidation, so that it can do reward and transition revaluation fairly well. \n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't modelled the hippocampal memory prior to consolidation, I've just shown that the generative model can learn the tasks (through causal sequence modelling, i.e. 'prediction error minimisation' on stored 'memories'). As discussed you might expect reward revaluation soon after encoding to be easier - you can retrieve a (non-consolidated) sequence from HPC then infer the rewards for a different reward category, whereas transition revaluation requires knowledge of transition probabilities to be extracted from the memories."
