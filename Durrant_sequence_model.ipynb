    "### Modelling statistical learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the effect of sleep on statistical learning, Durrant et al. (2011) constructed two types of sequence, both made up of regular tones at differing frequencies. One type had a structure in which the preceding two tones determined the next, except for a few transitions which were random to avoid repetition. The other type was the reverse – most transitions were random. After listening to a structured sequence, participants were tested on their ability distinguish short structured and unstructured sequences. Delayed recall was then tested, after a night’s sleep for one group, and after a waking rest for the other. Durrant et al. (2011) found that sleep improved performance more than waking rest, suggesting systems consolidation promotes statistical learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we generate a set of sequences based on the transition structure in Durrant et al. (2011). A model with the GPT-2 architecture is trained from scratch on the structured sequences only. At the end of each epoch of the training, the perplexity is calculated for a two test sets of structured and unstructured sequences. We find that the difference in perplexity of these two sets increases over time, corresponding to improved ability to distinguish them. In addition, outputs from the trained model are structured in the same way as the training data.\n",
