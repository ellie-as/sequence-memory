One day, she went to the park with her mom. She saw a big hill with a hole in it. She wondered what was inside. She ran to the hill with her camera and pointed it at the hole.

""Hello, is anyone there?"" she asked.

Suddenly, a small furry animal popped out of the hole. It had a long nose and tiny eyes. It was a mole.

""Who are you?"" the mole asked.

""I'm Sara. I have a camera. I want to record you. Can I?"" Sara said.

The mole was shy. He did not like cameras. He did not like strangers. He wanted to be safe in his hole.

""No, you can't. Go away. Leave me alone."" the mole said.

He tried to go back into his hole, but Sara was too quick. She grabbed him by his tail and lifted him up.

""Please, let me go. I'm scared. I don't like this."" the mole cried.

""Can I swim with them, mom?"" Lily asked.

""No, Lily, you can't swim with them. They live in the museum. They are not for swimming. They are for looking and learning,"" mom said.

Lily was sad. She wanted to swim with the fish and turtles. She loved swimming. She was good at swimming. She had a swimsuit and goggles in her backpack.

Lily saw a sign. The sign said ""Do not touch the pool"". Lily did not read the sign. She did not know what it meant. She saw a bench near the pool. She had an idea.

""Help! Help!"" mom shouted. She saw Lily in the pool. She was angry and worried. She ran to the pool. She called a guard.

The guard was an elderly man. He had gray hair and glasses. He heard mom's shout. He saw Lily in the pool. He was surprised and annoyed. He took a net. He went to the pool.

He tried to catch Lily with the net. Lily did not want to be caught. She swam away from the net. She thought it was a game. She laughed.

The guard did not think it was a game. He was tired and grumpy. He chased Lily with the net. He said ""Stop! Stop! Get out of the pool!""

Lily did not stop. She did not get out of the pool. She swam faster and faster. She had fun.

The guard did not have fun. He swam slower and slower. He had trouble breathing. He felt dizzy.

He dropped the net. He sank to the bottom of the pool.

Lily saw the guard. She saw he was not moving. She saw he was not smiling. She was scared. She realized he was not playing. She realized he needed help.

She swam to the guard. She grabbed his arm. She pulled him to the surface. She shouted ""Help! Help! The man is sick!""

Mom heard Lily's shout. She saw the guard in the pool. She saw he was not breathing. She was shocked and scared. She called for help.

Other people heard mom's call. They came to the pool. They saw the guard in the pool. They saw Lily holding him. They were amazed and worried. They helped the guard out of the pool. They called an ambulance.

The ambulance came. The paramedics checked the guard. They said he had a heart attack. They said Lily saved his life. They said she was brave and smart. They took the guard to the hospital.

Mom hugged Lily. She said she was sorry and proud. She said she loved her. She said they had to leave the museum. She said they had to go home.

Lily nodded. She said she was sorry and happy. She said she loved her. She said she liked the museum. She said she liked swimming. She said she hoped the guard would be okay.

"Sara was a wealthy girl who had many toys and clothes. She liked to show off her things to her friends and make them feel bad. She did not like to share or be kind. One day, she invited Lisa to her house to play. Lisa was a poor girl who had few toys and clothes. She was happy to see Sara's things, but Sara was mean to her.

""Look at my doll, Lisa. She is so pretty and expensive. You don't have a doll like this, do you?"" Sara said.

""No, I don't. She is very pretty. Can I hold her?"" Lisa asked.

""No, you can't. You might break her or make her dirty. You can only look at her. And don't touch anything else in my room. They are all mine."" Sara said.

Lisa felt sad and hurt. She wanted to play with Sara, but Sara only wanted to hurt her. She wished she had a friend who was nice and caring.

Sara got tired of playing with her things and decided to take a nap. She told Lisa to sit on the floor and be quiet. She locked the door of her room and went to sleep on her big bed. She did not care about Lisa at all.

Lisa felt scared and lonely. She wanted to go home, but she could not open the door. She knocked on the door and called for Sara, but Sara did not wake up. She cried and prayed for someone to help her.

But no one came. Sara's parents were out for the day and did not know that Lisa was in the house. Sara's house was far from the road and no one could hear Lisa's cries. Lisa stayed in the locked room for a long time, without food or water or comfort. She became sick and weak and cold.

When Sara's parents came back, they found Sara sleeping on her bed and Lisa lying on the floor, still and pale. They called for help, but it was too late. Lisa was dead.

She did not like to share or be kind. Sara's wealth and material possessions made her feel superior to others, leading her to treat others poorly and with disrespect. This behavior ultimately led to a tragic event where Sara's actions resulted in the death of her friend Lisa.

Sara's wealth and abundance of toys and clothes did not bring her happiness or fulfillment. Instead, it fueled her selfishness and lack of empathy towards others. She used her possessions as a way to belittle and exclude others, rather than using them to bring joy and connection to those around her.

""Ha ha, Tom, I have a ring and you don't!"" Sara said. ""You are silly. The ring is harmless. It is just a ring.""

But the ring was not harmless. It was a bad ring. It had a spell on it. The ring made Sara mean and greedy. The ring made Sara forget Tom and everything else. The ring made Sara want more and more things.

Soon, Sara saw a bike near the house. She wanted the bike. She ran to the bike and tried to take it. But the bike belonged to Ben, the boy who lived in the house. Ben saw Sara and got angry.

""Hey, that is my bike! Give it back!"" Ben said. He ran to Sara and pushed her. Sara fell down and hurt her knee. She cried.

""Go away, you bad girl! You are a thief!"" Ben said. He took his bike and rode away.
