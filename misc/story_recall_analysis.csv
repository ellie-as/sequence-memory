""Hello, is anyone there?"" she asked.

Suddenly, a small furry animal popped out of the hole. It had a long nose and tiny eyes. It was a mole.

""Who are you?"" the mole asked.

""I'm Sara. I have a camera. I want to record you. Can I?"" Sara said.

The mole was shy. He did not like cameras. He did not like strangers. He wanted to be safe in his hole.

""No, you can't. Go away. Leave me alone."" the mole said.

"Sara was a wealthy girl who had many toys and clothes. She liked to show off her things to her friends and make them feel bad. She did not like to share or be kind. One day, she invited Lisa to her house to play. Lisa was a poor girl who had few toys and clothes. She was happy to see Sara's things, but Sara was mean to her.

""Look at my doll, Lisa. She is so pretty and expensive. You don't have a doll like this, do you?"" Sara said.

""No, I don't. She is very pretty. Can I hold her?"" Lisa asked.

""No, you can't. You might break her or make her dirty. You can only look at her. And don't touch anything else in my room. They are all mine."" Sara said.

Lisa felt sad and hurt. She wanted to play with Sara, but Sara only wanted to hurt her. She wished she had a friend who was nice and caring.

Sara got tired of playing with her things and decided to take a nap. She told Lisa to sit on the floor and be quiet. She locked the door of her room and went to sleep on her big bed. She did not care about Lisa at all.

Lisa felt scared and lonely. She wanted to go home, but she could not open the door. She knocked on the door and called for Sara, but Sara did not wake up. She cried and prayed for someone to help her.

But no one came. Sara's parents were out for the day and did not know that Lisa was in the house. Sara's house was far from the road and no one could hear Lisa's cries. Lisa stayed in the locked room for a long time, without food or water or comfort. She became sick and weak and cold.

When Sara's parents came back, they found Sara sleeping on her bed and Lisa lying on the floor, still and pale. They called for help, but it was too late. Lisa was dead.

""Go away, you bad girl! You are a thief!"" Ben said. He took his bike and rode away.

Sara was sad and scared. She wanted Tom. She wanted to take off the ring. But the ring was stuck on her finger. It would not come off. The ring was too tight. It hurt her finger.

Eventually, he was able to save up enough money to buy the big toy car that he had been dreaming of. Tim's determination and hard work paid off, and he was able to enjoy playing with his new toy car thanks to his efforts.","When Tom was a boy who liked to play with cars, he would often bring his toy cars to the park to play with. One day, while playing with his cars, he noticed a bright orange ball that caught his eye. Without thinking, Tom picked up the ball and started playing with it, not realizing that it belonged to another child at the park.

Tom's mom had always taught him the importance of asking permission before taking something that didn't belong to him. As he continued to play with the ball, he started to feel guilty for not asking for permission. Remembering his mom's advice, Tom decided to approach the child who owned the ball and apologize for taking it without asking.

The child was initially upset with Tom for taking the ball without permission, but was impressed by Tom's honesty and willingness to apologize. The two boys ended up playing together with the ball and Tom's cars, and they quickly became friends.

Through this experience, Tom learned the importance of kindness and politeness, as well as the value of asking permission before taking something that doesn't belong to him. This lesson not only helped him make a new friend at the park, but also taught him the importance of owning up to his mistakes and making amends.",1614,151,254,0.4521078546702184,0.3912029041369241,0.67558625600035
